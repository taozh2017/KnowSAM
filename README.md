We will release the code for "Learnable Prompting SAM-induced Knowledge Distillation for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation" soon.


## Installation

To set up the environment and install dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

We provide a reference sample dataset (SampleData.rar) that allows users to quickly test and run the model. Extract the dataset using the following command:
```bash
unrar x SampleData.rar
```

To train the model on a dataset, execute:
```bash
python train_semi_SAM.py
